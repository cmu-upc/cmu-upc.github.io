On January 24, 2016, we were excited to welcome Doug Polk to the UPC. We began with a Q&A session, where UPC members were encouraged to ask Doug any questions they had about his life, his experiences, or high stakes poker in general. Doug graciously shared some of his better stories, along with some advice for the members on poker play. Afterwards, we gave individual members an opportunity to meet Doug and take pictures. Finally, we held a short tournament, where members were able to test their skills against one of the best in the world. While Doug did end up busting from the tournament, he definitely gave our club an experience to remember.

We would like to congratulate Bradley Guan for winning the tournament. He ended up eliminating his roommate, David Hua, who became our second place finisher. The winning hand was King Ten offsuit. The prizes for Bradley were two signed (by Doug) sets of Copag playing cards. Our third place finisher was Daniel Lei.
