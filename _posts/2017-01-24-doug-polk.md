On January 24, 2016, we were excited to welcome Doug Polk to the UPC for a big event. We began with a Q&A session, where UPC members were encouraged to ask Doug any questions they had about his life, his experiences, or high stakes poker in general. Doug graciously shared some of his better stories, along with some advice for the members on poker play. Afterward, we held a picture taking session, where we took a group picture of the UPC and gave individual members an opportunity to meet Doug and take pictures. Finally, we held a short tournament, where members were able to test their skills against one of the best in the world. While Doug did end up busting from the tournament, he definitely gave our club an experience to remember for a lifetime.

We would like to congratulate Bradley Guan for winning the tournament. He successfully navigated through the field in the early stages of the tournament, and skillfully played the final table to come out on top. He ended up eliminating his roommate, David Hua, who became our second place finisher. The winning hand was King Ten offsuit. The prizes for Bradley were two  signed (by Doug) sets of Copaq playing cards. David won a UPC t-shirt, and our third place finisher, Daniel Lei, won a $15 Starbucks gift card.
