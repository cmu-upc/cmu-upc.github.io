On November 12, 2016, we partnered with the Chinese Students Association to co-host a campus-wide tournament featuring our biggest prize pool to date: $250. By combining our budgets and charging a $5 admission fee (free for UPC due-paying members, of course), we were able to provide payouts for the entire final table, with a whopping $100 in value going to first place. Free food and refreshments were provided for the over forty participants who joined us this evening for 6-max No Limit Hold-Em.

We would like to congratulate Mohin Banker for binking the tournament. Mohin dominated the field as the big stack for most of the levels, culminating in a final knockout blow to our second place finisher, Rahul Jaisingh, with the hand Ace Three offsuit.
