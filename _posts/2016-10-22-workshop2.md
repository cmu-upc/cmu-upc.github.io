Today’s workshop consisted of analyzing two hands from professional play, one in a cash game and the other in a tournament setting.  We discussed the merits and demerits of the decisions made by each famous player, including Daniel Negreanu and Johnny Chan, and what they would have done differently given improved knowledge of their opponents’ ranges.
