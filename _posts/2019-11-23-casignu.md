On November 23, UPC and the CMU Chapter of Sig Nu collaborated to host CaSigNu Royale, an annual poker tournament for charity. All proceeds were donated to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. St. Jude is leading the way the world understands, treats, and defeats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases.

Above, three super high stakes GTO crushers deliberate the pros and cons of quarter-pot Cbets on monotone flops. 

The prize pool was a total of $450. The entry fee was a $5 donation and rebuys were allowed. Thank you to everyone who showed up!
